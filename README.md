# ExpFamilyDistributions

*Julia package for using distributions member of the Exponential
family .*

This package is mostly designed to build machine learning
Bayesian models. Particularly, it provides functions to use both the
natural and the standard parameters of the distributions. For a general
purpose statistical Julia package we recommend to use
[Distributions.jl](https://github.com/JuliaStats/Distributions.jl).
